                    <p>Olá! Meu nome é Fernanda Lima Linhares e sou a fundadora do projeto SoulEnglish BR,  graduada em Letras Inglês pela Universidade Estadual da Paraíba. Além disso, tenho uma pós-graduação em Literatura Americana e atualmente estou cursando outra pós-graduação em Metodologia da Língua Inglesa.
    
                      Com uma experiência docente de 10 anos, venho desenvolvendo minha paixão pelo ensino e aprendizagem da língua inglesa.
                      
                      Tive a oportunidade enriquecedora de realizar um intercâmbio na Irlanda, onde aprimorei ainda mais meu domínio do idioma, obtendo o certificado C1 em Língua Inglesa. Estou sempre em busca de aprimoramento profissional e de novas estratégias para proporcionar uma educação de qualidade aos meus alunos.
                      
                      É um prazer compartilhar minha jornada e conhecimentos com vocês!</p>

                    <h3>Sunflower</h3>
                    <p>Sunflowers are known for being “happy” flowers, making them the perfect gift to bring
                      joy to someone’s (or your) day.The common sunflower has a green erect stem covered
                      in coarse hairs, growing on average around 2m tall. The leaves are
                      broad, with serrated edges, and are alternately arranged on the stem. The ‘flower’
                      of the common sunflower is actually a
                      pseudanthium, or flowerhead, made up of many small flowers. The outer yellow
                      ‘petals’ on the flowerhead are known as ray
                      flowers and are made up of multiple petals fused together. Ray petals are usually
                      yellow but can sometimes be red or
                      orange. The black-brown flowers in the centre of the head, called disk flowers, grow
                      in a spiral formation, and mature
                      into sunflower seeds over time.Sunflower seeds are processed to create sunflower
                      oil, a cooking oil that is both cheap to produce and high in
                      unsaturated fats.Sunflower seeds are eaten both raw and roasted as a snack. They can
                      also be processed to create sunflower butter, an
                      alternative to peanut butter.Sunflower oil can be processed into margarine.Some
                      Native American peoples use ground sunflower seeds to make bread-like products.Did
                      you know? Sunflower petals are edible, but they aren't widely eaten due to their
                      flavour.</p>

                    <h3>Daisy</h3>
                    <p>Daisies are simple yet sophisticated and are some of the most beautiful flowers in
                      the floral world.Daisy plants often grow to about 2 to 3 feet (61 to 91 centimeters)
                      tall. The flowers grow on long stalks. Two types of
                      flower make up each flower head. Ray flowers are what people call petals. The ray
                      flowers may be long or short. Tiny
                      disk flowers make up the center. The center may be flat or rounded. Depending on the
                      type of daisy, the flower heads are
                      from 1 to 4 inches (2.5 to 10 centimeters) wide.Oxeye and Shasta daisies have a ring
                      of white ray flowers around a bright yellow center. The ray flowers of the English
                      daisy may be white, purple, pink, or red.With its soft, pearly white petals
                      radiating from a golden center, the Shasta daisy is a timeless classic. Not is it
                      only one of the largest daisies, but it is also one of the easiest to grow and care
                      for. Plus, you can enjoy its hearty
                      blooms season after season.The sweet simplicity and genuine beauty of the daisy have
                      made the flower an international emblem of innocence and
                      purity. Its fresh, crisp appearance has come to symbolize new beginnings, and its
                      bright, spirit-lifting colors are
                      known to spread happiness like wildfire. It’s for these reasons that daisies make
                      the perfect gifts and decorations for
                      celebrating all of life’s biggest milestone events.</p>

                    <h3>Orchid</h3>
                    <p>Orchids are delicate, exotic and graceful. They represent love, luxury, beauty and
                      strength.Orchids are plants prized for their beautiful and unique flowers. Orchids
                      make up one of the world’s largest plant
                      families, with between 15,000 and 35,000 species, or types. Many people grow orchids
                      as a hobby.
                      Orchids grow in most parts of the world except for the areas near the North and
                      South poles. Most orchids prefer warm,
                      tropical areas. Orchids can grow in soil, completely underground, or on other plants
                      or rocks. The species that grow on
                      other plants or rocks do not have their roots in soil. Instead, their roots dangle
                      in the air or cling to the plant or
                      rock. They get moisture and nutrients from rainwater, rotting plant matter, or the
                      air.
                      Orchid plants can measure from less than an inch (2.5 centimeters) to more than 15
                      feet (4.6 meters) tall. There can be
                      a single flower or clusters. The flowers can be as small as 0.1 inch (2.5
                      millimeters) or as large as 15 inches (38
                      centimeters) across. They can be almost any color, and some have spots or streaks.
                      Many have a strong fragrance, or
                      smell, but some have no fragrance at all.
                      The flavoring known as vanilla comes from the seedpods of some orchid plants. It is
                      used in baked goods and beverages,
                      and it is an ingredient in perfumes as well.</p>

                    <h3>Chrysanthemum</h3>
                    <p>Chrysanthemum flowers come in a variety of sizes, ranging from 5 to 8 centimeters in
                      diameter. Chrysanthemums are
                      composite flowers that grow in varying petal arrangements, with some types having a
                      daisy-like structure, others having
                      a rounder, pompom-like appearance, and even some blooms with quill-like petals. The
                      blossoms also have varying hues,
                      from white and light yellow to deep burgundies and purples. Chrysanthemums have a
                      sweet and floral scent with notes of
                      menthol that clear the nasal passages. The flavor profile of Chrysanthemums may
                      differ depending on the variety, but
                      commonly the blossoms have bitter and floral nuances with sweet and peppery
                      undertones.Chrysanthemum flower is the generalized term for thousands of commonly
                      grown perennials, affectionately known as mums.
                      These species of flowering plants are members of the daisy family and bloom in a
                      vast array of colors and shapes. All
                      mum flowers are edible, with the most common variety, pictured above, being Garland
                      chrysanthemums, botanically
                      classified as Chrysanthemum coronarium. This variety is also grown for its leafy
                      greens and succulent stems, known as
                      Shungiku in many Asian cultures. Garland chrysanthemums are one of the only
                      varieties whose greens are edible. Other
                      species of Chrysanthemum greens can cause contact dermatitis when handled without
                      gloves and may result in digestive
                      irritation when consumed. Chrysanthemum flowers produce a natural pesticide that
                      helps with pest control in home gardens
                      but is also toxic to household pests. Throughout history, Chrysanthemums have been a
                      symbol of love, life, and rebirth.
                      They are often gifted at baby showers and birthdays and are placed as offerings to
                      the Goddess Lakshmi during Diwali
                      Puja in Hindu culture. Mums are one of the most used edible flowers today, elevating
                      the color, texture, dimension, and
                      flavor of many different culinary creations.</p>
